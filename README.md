# Exercises and Notes From "RL: An Introduction 2nd by Sutton et al."

## Overview

This repository serves as a dump for my work while I'm going through the book.
The exercises will primarily be implemented in Python3 and the notes are written
using LaTeX.
This repository will by no means be extensive and all of my work should be taken with
a grain of salt as I am not an expert on machine learning or reinforcement learning.
The exercises that have been "solved" (implemented) are of my choosing, if there are some
programming challenges from the book that are not here but you are having trouble with
feel free to reach out.
If you run into any problems/bugs I would appreciate a description of the problem and I'll
try and address it asap.
Keep in mind that most of these scripts are first working drafts so might not be optimal
and may contain bugs.
